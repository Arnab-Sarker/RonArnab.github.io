The neutrino oscillations offer great potential for probing new physics effects beyond the Standard Model. Any additional effect on neutrino oscillations can help understand the nature of these non-standard effects. The violation of fundamental symmetries may appear as new physics effects in various neutrino experiments. Lorentz symmetry is one such fundamental symmetry in nature, the violation of which implies a breakdown of space-time symmetry. The Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) is intrinsic in nature and its effects exist even in a vacuum. Neutrinos can be an intriguing probe for exploring such violations of Lorentz symmetry. The effect of violation of Lorentz Invariance can be explored through the impact on the neutrino oscillation probabilities. The effect of LIV is treated as a perturbation to the standard neutrino Hamiltonian considering the Standard Model Extension (SME) framework. In this work, we have probed the effect of LIV on the neutrino oscillation measurements considering the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) as a case study. The inclusion of LIV affects various neutrino oscillation parameters as it modifies the standard neutrino oscillation probabilities. We looked into the capability of DUNE in constraining the LIV parameters and then explored the impact of CPT-violating LIV terms on the mass-induced neutrino oscillation probabilities. We have also probed the influence of LIV parameters on the CP-measurement sensitivity at DUNE.
